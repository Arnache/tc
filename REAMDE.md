# tc
The C++ class `tc` implements operations +,-,*,/,etc... on pairs of a complex number together with a derivative (1-jets). I have been using it to simplify computing derivatives in my computer programs (that draw objects related to holomorphic dynamical systems).

See the comments in the code.
